    <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
    <br>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in other media.</li>
    <br>
    <li><del>CSS is not necessary</del> <mark> CSS saves a lot of work.</mark> It can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once</li>
    <br>
    <li class="e">
        <u>External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</u>
    </li></ol>
    <h3> CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways: </h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
    <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External- by using a link element link to an external CSS file 
    <li class="ul">
        The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however,<span>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself</ul>
<p class="para-1">
    When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript
</p>
<p class="para-2">
    In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a styleor set of styles can be applied to the elements
</p>
<p class="para-3">
    There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly usedare class and ID. Both are used to  target elements to which a style should be applied
